# Studio Leismann Utils

Studio Leismann Utils is a modular helper plugin that adds WordPress editor tooling.

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.3 or newer
- PHP 8.1 or newer

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin into `wp-content/plugins/` and activate it.
2. Visit **Settings → Studio Leismann Utils** to review which modules are active.

## Included modules
1. **CSS Classes Panel** – shows all helper classes in the inspector sidebar, lets editors toggle classes, and highlights active selections.

### 1. CSS Classes Panel highlights

- Automatically parses `studiolsm-helpers.scss` to list helper classes and breakpoint variants.
- Provides search and section headings for quick discovery.
- Works in both the editor and on the frontend by enqueueing the compiled CSS.
- Supports lookups in the module assets, legacy plugin folder, and common theme paths, and can be filtered via `studiolsm_utility_classes_scss_path`.

```php
add_filter( 'studiolsm_utility_classes_scss_path', function( $path ) {
    return get_theme_file_path( 'assets/scss/utilities/studiolsm-helpers.scss' );
} );
```

## Development

Source code now lives in `src/` and is transpiled into `build/` for distribution. The plugin loader automatically prefers the compiled files when present, and falls back to `src/` during development.

- Install dependencies once with `npm install`.
- Run `npm run build` to produce the compiled PHP, CSS, and supporting assets in `build/`.
- Run `npm run start` for a watcher that rebuilds on file changes.

The build pipeline:
- walks `src/modules/**/assets/scss/*.scss` and emits the matching `assets/css/*.css` files via `@wordpress/scripts`.
- copies the remaining PHP and assets into the `build/` directory so the plugin can run without the `src/` tree.
- strips the empty JavaScript stubs generated by the CSS build step.

Commit only the source files; rebuild locally or on deployment whenever the SCSS or PHP changes.
